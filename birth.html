        <h2><i class="fas fa-birthday-cake"></i>birthdate</h2>
        <p>02. May. 2016, actually this is not my exact birthday. However, the day my mom adopted me was selected as my birthday!</p>
      </section>
      <section class="place">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-home"></i>place</h2>
        <p>I was born in a petshop named 'Petshop Eddy' in Lima, Peru. Actually, there was my sister too who was super cheerful.<br>
          Not like my sister, I was very shy and literally shivering from fear, but mom chose me! Yes, I am the chosen one! Luckiest man ever!
      </section>
      <section class="name">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-bone"></i>name</h2>
        <p> I am curious! Why my name is Mandu? What is the meaning of Mandu? Anyone can please let me know? <br>
         Once I overheard that my mom was preparing her dinner, then she said "Okay, tonight beer with Mandu" That was so odd.
