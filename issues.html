   <i class="fas fa-umbrella-beach"></i>PUNTA HERMOSA
 <p>On 8th of December 2018, me and my mom's friends we went to the beach Punta Hermosa.
   This time not only with her, but also with her friends so I got more excited running around the beach! While my mom was reading her book in the beach, I got attacked from the big street dogs.
   Luckily my mom's friend rescued me, but I was bleeding too much and without any choice my mom carried me to a vet near there urgently. She was crying a lot on the way to the vet.
   The doctor checked me up, later I was under anethesia for a while. That was the wierd moment. It was a nightmare!!</p></div>

   <i class="fas fa-walking"></i>MALECON
 <p>On 21th of March 2020, my mom finished her class and came back home around 10:30pm. Then we went out to the park near home.
 She was texing to her friends and I was smelling and walking around by my self. Two other dogs without leash attacked me, and my mom ran to me.
But it was too late, I was bleeding again! She was so angry and with that drunken owner we went to the vet near home.
While I was in vet, there was some issues! The owner told her that he will bring some money from home, then he never came back!!
So she got angry and went to his home and called to the police. Then? Of course, she got won!</p></div>

   <i class="fas fa-road"></i></i>HIGHWAY
 <p>On 10th of March 2020, my mom decided to move to Arequipa. I remember this city. We went there about 16months ago.
 She was driving like 10hours almost straight, we were near city of Arequipa. Only 2 hours left. But we had accident.
The crash was huge. I heard that my mom was screaming and looking for me unpatienly because after accident, I was so afraid and hiden
under the seat. She found me and was relived and one ambulance took her to the hospital. And I was left in the car for 8hours until my mom picked me up in the middle of night after medical check up.
She looked so devastated and exhuasted that night.</p></div>
 <div class="case4">
   <i class="fas fa-house-user"></i>QUARANTINE
 <p>On 29 of March 2020. every sunday is 24hrs quarantine day.
   My mom all the time take me out at least 2 times a day. But this 24hrs quarantine made her a bit uncomfortable. As everyone knows, I love going out.
   I can walk around by my self. So she let me do that! She opened entrance door of the apartment and I went out alone! I was so happy walking and semlling around freely. Then I went to park where I watch everyday from window.
  I had great time, but I saw some fellows over there and I was a little embarrased. Then with one of them I had fight!My mom was looking at me from the window, then she saw the fight and came down directly.
My heart was bumping and at least this time I got no hurt. What a relief!</p></div>
